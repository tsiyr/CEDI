                        <p>It is considered a brain disorder, because it involves functional changes to brain circuits involved in reward, stress, and self-control, and those changes may last a long time after a person has stopped taking drugs.</p>

                        <h3 class="headings_">Treatment</h3>
                        <p>Drug treatment for those who suffer from substance abuse disorder, focus on changing behavior or the prescription of alternative drugs for victims of drug dependency to be able to withdraw or find a substitution for the lifestyle of drug addiction, they are used to or a combination of both. The treatment for drug dependency or addiction is successful and effective most of the time in the long term, when they are adequately resourced in funds and treatment are administered by skilled people who run the treatment programs.</p>
                        <h5 class="headings_">Treatment Options for those struggling with Drug Addiction</h5>
                        <p><strong>Counselling</strong> is the most common kind of treatment and for many people this can be the first step to openly discuss with others (professionals) about their drug use. It involves talking through your problems, learning to change the way you think, or thinking about how you might deal with difficult situation. Counselling can be provided individually or in a group situation, and is available both to people who use drugs, and to their family members or other support people.</p>
                        <p><strong>Detoxification</strong> is the treatment of chronic drug use generally it requires a person to go through a period of detoxification (process of removing all forms of harmful drugs from the body) or withdrawal in order to achieve complete stoppage of drug use. Withdrawal symptoms can range from mild to severe, and differ depending on the duration of use, type of drug, age, the person’s physical and psychological characteristics and the method of withdrawal. The process of detoxification involves getting rid of the drugs from the body which can usually be achieved in 7-14 days.</p>
                        <p><strong>Residential Rehabilitation</strong> is based on the principle that a drug free residential setting is helpful for confronting the underlying causes of drug addiction and associated behaviors. In this setting the focus is on the “Un-learning” of negative behaviours and developing the required skills and positive attitude to assist drug users to achieve a drug free lifestyle. The success of residential rehabilitation largely depends on how long the individual remains in treatment.</p>
                        <p><strong>Outpatient</strong> is this type of treatment that range from drop-in centers to individual and group counseling sessions which provide education, medical and psychological services. These programmes have far less restrictions than residential programmes and consequentially are more suited to those living in a stable and supportive environment or for those that do not have financial resources for residential treatment.</p>
                        <p>Substance abuse and habit have such huge numbers of impact and dimensions that can upset essentially every parts of a person's life, treatment isn't straightforward. Most treatment programs regularly consolidate numerous segments, each coordinated to a specific part of the ailment and its results. Addiction treatment must help an individual quit utilizing drugs, maintain a drug-free lifestyle, and achieve productive functioning in the family, at work, and in society.</p>
                        <p>Since addiction is a disease, a great number of people scarcely can quit utilizing drugs for a couple of days and be relieved. Patients regularly require long term treatment or repeated episodes of care to achieve the ultimate goal of sustained abstinence and recovery of their lives. Research has shown that the value of continuing care in treating addiction, with a variety of approaches, integrated in residential and community settings is the best to total recovery.</p>
                        <h5 class="headings_">How drugs abuse or substance abuse prompts addiction</h5>
                        <p>Substance abuse is a behaviour wherein an individual starts as a causal drug user as an intentional decision yet as times passes, that individual goes from being a free will drug user to being a compulsive drug user, Because after some time, the continued use of addictive drugs changes the brain in a dramatic, toxic ways, at others in more subtle ways, but virtually always in a way that result in compulsive and even uncontrollable drug use.<span class="read_more_btn"><strong>Read More</strong></span></p>

                        <h5 class="headings_">Principles of effective treatment</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Addiction is a complex but treatable disease that affects brain function and behavior.</strong> Drugs of abuse alter the brain’s structure and function, resulting in changes that persist long after drug use has ceased. This may explain why drug abusers are at risk for relapse even after long periods of abstinence and despite the potentially devastating consequences.</li>
                            <li><strong>No single treatment is appropriate for everyone.</strong> Treatment varies depending on the type of drug and the characteristics of the patients. Matching treatment settings, interventions, and services to an individual’s particular problems and needs is critical to his or her ultimate success in returning to productive functioning in the family, workplace, and society.</li>
                            <li><strong>Treatment needs to be readily available.</strong> Because drug-addicted individuals may be uncertain about entering treatment, taking advantage of available services the moment people are ready for treatment is critical. Potential patients can be lost if treatment is not immediately available or readily accessible. As with other chronic diseases, the earlier treatment is offered in the disease process, the greater the likelihood of positive outcomes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Effective treatment attends to multiple needs of the individual, not just his or her drug abuse.</strong> To be effective, treatment must address the individual’s drug abuse and any associated medical, psychological, social, vocational, and legal problems. It is also important that treatment be appropriate to the individual’s age, gender, ethnicity, and culture.</li>
                            <li><strong>Remaining in treatment for an adequate period of time is critical. </strong> The appropriate duration for an individual depends on the type and degree of the patient’s problems and needs. Research indicates that most addicted individuals need at least 3 months in treatment to significantly reduce or stop their drug use and that the best outcomes occur with longer durations of treatment. Recovery from drug addiction is a long-term process and frequently requires multiple episodes of treatment. As with other chronic illnesses, relapses to drug abuse can occur and should signal a need for treatment to be reinstated or adjusted. Because individuals often leave treatment prematurely, programs should include strategies to engage and keep patients in treatment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Behavioral therapies—including individual, family, or group counseling—are the most commonly used forms of drug abuse treatment.</strong> Behavioral therapies vary in their focus and may involve addressing a patient’s motivation to change, providing incentives for abstinence, building skills to resist drug use, replacing drug-using activities with constructive and rewarding activities, improving problem-solving skills, and facilitating better interpersonal relationships. Also, participation in group therapy and other peer support programs during and following treatment can help maintain abstinence.</li>
                            <li><strong>Medications are an important element of treatment for many patients, especially when combined with counseling and other behavioral therapies.</strong> For example, methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone (including a new long-acting formulation) are effective in helping individuals addicted to heroin or other opioids stabilize their lives and reduce their illicit drug use. Acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone are medications approved for treating alcohol dependence. For persons addicted to nicotine, a nicotine replacement product (available as patches, gum, lozenges, or nasal spray) or an oral medication (such as bupropion or varenicline) can be an effective component of treatment when part of a comprehensive behavioral treatment program.</li>
                            <li><strong>An individual's treatment and services plan must be assessed continually and modified as necessary to ensure that it meets his or her changing needs.</strong> A patient may require varying combinations of services and treatment components during the course of treatment and recovery. In addition to counseling or psychotherapy, a patient may require medication, medical services, family therapy, parenting instruction, vocational rehabilitation, and/or social and legal services. For many patients, a continuing care approach provides the best results, with the treatment intensity varying according to a person’s changing needs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Many drug-addicted individuals also have other mental disorders. </strong> Because drug abuse and addiction—both of which are mental disorders—often co-occur with other mental illnesses, patients presenting with one condition should be assessed for the other(s). And when these problems co-occur, treatment should address both (or all), including the use of medications as appropriate.</li>
                            <li><strong>Medically assisted detoxification is only the first stage of addiction treatment and by itself does little to change long-term drug abuse</strong>. Although medically assisted detoxification can safely manage the acute physical symptoms of withdrawal and can, for some, pave the way for effective long-term addiction treatment, detoxification alone is rarely sufficient to help addicted individuals achieve long-term abstinence. Thus, patients should be encouraged to continue drug treatment following detoxification. Motivational enhancement and incentive strategies, begun at initial patient intake, can improve treatment engagement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Treatment does not need to be voluntary to be effective.</strong> Sanctions or enticements from family, employment settings, and/or the criminal justice system can significantly increase treatment entry, retention rates, and the ultimate success of drug treatment interventions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Drug use during treatment must be monitored continuously, as lapses during treatment do occur. </strong>Knowing their drug use is being monitored can be a powerful incentive for patients and can help them withstand urges to use drugs. Monitoring also provides an early indication of a return to drug use, signaling a possible need to adjust an individual’s treatment plan to better meet his or her needs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Treatment programs should test patients for the presence of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases as well as provide targeted risk-reduction counseling, linking patients to treatment if necessary.</strong> Typically, drug abuse treatment addresses some of the drug-related behaviors that put people at risk of infectious diseases. Targeted counseling focused on reducing infectious disease risk can help patients further reduce or avoid substance-related and other high-risk behaviors. Counseling can also help those who are already infected to manage their illness. Moreover, engaging in substance abuse treatment can facilitate adherence to other medical treatments. Substance abuse treatment facilities should provide onsite, rapid HIV testing rather than referrals to offsite testing—research shows that doing so increases the likelihood that patients will be tested and receive their test results. Treatment providers should also inform patients that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has proven effective in combating HIV, including among drug-abusing populations, and help link them to HIV treatment if they test positive.</li>
