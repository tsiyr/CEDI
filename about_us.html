                        <p>The Compassionate Recovery Center has just one mission - help clients achieve a life of recovery by providing evidence-based alcohol and drug addiction treatment in the society. We believe clients who are treated
                            well get well sooner and stay well together, which is why we treat every client with dignity, and respect as we use individualize treatment. </p>
                        <p>We have developed a team of experienced, compassionate clinicians, counselors, nurses, and therapists to guide clients and their families through treatment and into lasting, meaningful recovery. Our full continuum of care includes:</p>
                        <p>We are determined to deliver an addiction treatment and admissions process which is easier, more accessible, more affordable, and more effective. Our treatment focuses on healing and strengthening the mind, behavior modification,
                            physical therapy, and spiritual healing, increasing the likelihood of achieving and maintaining recovery.</p>
                        <h5 class="headings_">Our Philosophy</h5>
                        <p>The Compassionate Recovery Center recognizes addiction as a mental health disorder. Therefore, our approach to treatment is the same way we approach any other mental health condition — by treating the emotional, mental and physical symptoms
                            simultaneously while addressing the root cause.</p>
                        <p>We accomplish this by providing clients with access to addiction experts, personal treatment plans tailored to meet their needs, aftercare programs and other resources for longterm healing. We treat the whole person instead of focusing only on their addiction and we make sure to address underlying conditions that can contribute to substance abuse.</p>
                        <p>Our long-term treatment plan gives the client time for their brain and body to be able to fight the strong cravings and stay in recovery, and it has been scientifically proven that the longer a client stays in treatment the better they recover. Research indicates that most addicted individuals need at least 3 months in treatment to significantly reduce or stop their drug use and that the best outcomes occur with longer durations of treatment. Our philosophy is that we and the families are all in this together. We understand the wreckage left behind when a loved one is struggling with addiction. To help families heal together, we have developed specific family programming at our facility to psycho educate and help you better and faster.</p>
                        <h5 class="headings_">Our Core Beliefs</h5>
                        <p>At The Compassionate Recovery Center we believe in delivering safe, effective care to each client that entrusts us with their health. We believe that:</p>

                            <li>Anyone can recover from addiction.</li>
                            <li>Every client deserves respectful, compassionate care.</li>
                            <li>Addiction is a disease that can be treated with evidence-based and research-backed care.</li>
                            <li>Treating substance use and co-occurring mental health conditions simultaneously can lead to lasting healing</li>
                            <li>Recovery is a journey that requires a lifelong commitment.</li>
                        </ul>
